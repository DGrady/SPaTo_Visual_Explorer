This is the Processing PDF library from revision r8413.
We use this rather than the one from r7148 to avoid the costly
PGraphicsPDF.listFonts() call.  Includes some slight modification
to make it work with the modified r7148 core.

The Procesing core library is released under the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and is part of the Processing project:
